# Getting-Cleaning-Data
## Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains the r script *run_analysis.R* and the associaated code book *CodeBook.MD* that were used to create the following two tidy datasets using activity tracking data from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy 5 (original dataset at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones): 

* Merged training and testing data
* Summary mean values for each activity and each subject

**GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.**

**The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.**

**The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.**

Data for this project was obtained at the following URL:

**You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.**

**Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.**
